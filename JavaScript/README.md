# Rhino.Inside.JavaScript
Rhino Inside® technology allows Rhino and Grasshopper to be embedded within other products.
### Running Rhino and Grasshopper inside various JavaScript Runtimes / Frameworks (Node.js, Electron, Chromium Embedded Framework)


## Samples

Samples are available in the [Rhino Developer Samples repository](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples/tree/7/rhino.inside/javascript)

## JavaScript Runtimes / Frameworks

The samples show how to run Rhino.Inside the following JavaScript frameworks:
- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3. Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [`Electron.js`](https://electronjs.org/) - Sample 4. Electron is an open-source framework developed and maintained by GitHub. Electron allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies: It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime.
- [`Chromium Embedded Framework (CefSharp)`](https://cefsharp.github.io/) - Sample 5. The Chromium Embedded Framework is an open-source software framework for embedding a Chromium web browser within another application. 

## Dependencies
- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org) - It is crucial to install Node.js prior to running any of these samples.
- [`Edge.js`](https://github.com/agracio/edge-js) - This is used to call .NET functions from JavaScript in Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3, and Sample 4. Sample 5 uses the mechanism in CEF to pass data between .NET and JavaScript.
