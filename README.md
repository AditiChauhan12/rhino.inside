The Rhino.InsideÂ® technology allows Rhino and Grasshopper to be embedded within other products.  It may be possible to:

* Starting Rhino and Grasshopper as an add in another product.
* Call directly into the host's native APIs from a Grasshopper or Rhino plugin.
* Access Rhino's APIs through the host application.
* Grasshopper definitions can be opened and previewed in Rhino within the same process as the parent.
* Object can be natively created by Rhino or Grasshopper within the parent product.

This repository contains all the sample developer code for loading Rhino inside other 64-bit Windows applications.

The version of Rhino that these samples are compatible with is the Rhino WIP version that you can found [here](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/wip) .
